OAuth Flows
	Flow 1: Authorization code flow
		1.1 Person calls PhotoPrintingService
		1.2 PhotoPrintingService calls GoogleAuthorizationServer
		1.3 GoogleAuthorizationServer calls Person for confirmation
		1.4 Person authorize using his credentials
		1.5 GoogleAuthorizationServer sends "Auth token" to PhotoPrintingService
		1.6 PhotoPrintingService sends "Auth token" to GoogleAuthorizationServer to receive "Access token"
		1.7 GoogleAuthorizationServer sends "Access token" to PhotoPrintingService
		1.8 PhotoPrintingService sends "API Call" usint "Access token" to GoogleDrive
		1.9 GoogleDrive return information to PhotoPrintingService
	
	Flow 2: Implicit flow
		2.1 Person calls PhotoPrintingApp
		2.2 PhotoPrintingApp calls GoogleAuthorizationServer
		2.3 GoogleAuthorizationServer calls Person for confirmation
		2.4 Person authorize using his credentials
			XXX GoogleAuthorizationServer sends "Auth token" to PhotoPrintingApp
			XXX PhotoPrintingApp sends "Auth token" to GoogleAuthorizationServer to receive "Access token"
		2.5 GoogleAuthorizationServer sends "Access token" to PhotoPrintingApp (no OAuth token)
		2.6 PhotoPrintingApp sends "API Call" usint "Access token" to GoogleDrive
		2.7 GoogleDrive return information to PhotoPrintingApp
	
	Flow 3: Client credentials flow
			> the BIG use case
			> OAuth for "Authorization between services"
			> When the client is well trusted (confidential clients)
		3.1 Microservice1 calls AuthService for authentication
		3.2 AuthService returns the "Access token" to Microservice1
		3.3 Microservice1 calls Microservice2 using "Access token"
		3.4 Microservice2 returns a response requested by Microservice1
